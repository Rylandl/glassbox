# Status: gap against the charter

Updated 2026-09-21. Read [the charter](charter.md) first.

The requested shared-physics vehicle learner is built. One formulation learns
configuration-dependent accelerations and hidden response from recordings while
sharing gravity, body/world transforms and SO(3) integration. It requires no
vehicle family, physical parameters, mixer, actuator layout or tuning choices.
Separate fitted weights per configuration are expected. The
[implementation and measured results](shared-vehicle-physics.md) describe its
research API, scope and remaining limitations.

The public recipe remains `generic-memory-v4-prototype`. The shared-physics
candidate produces large aggregate gains but fails its frozen wind and response
tail regression limits. Its development status must not be confused with a
passed acceptance verdict or arbitrary-system readiness.

| Criterion | Current | Target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| One recipe | One public recipe without tuning or vehicle dispatch. The shared-physics successor is an isolated research formulation with the same fixed fitting procedure across configurations. | One generic learner and consumer contract. |
| Accuracy | Shared physics reduces fresh matched aggregate forecast/response errors 43.95%/22.12% versus retained v4. Crazyflow improves 67.96%/45.76%; Cascade improves forecast 1.93% but response worsens 11.83%. Wind and one response-tail guard fail. The latest long-horizon refinement lowers fresh aggregate forecast/response errors only 0.60%/3.18% versus shared-v1, with Crazyflow regressions and Dart response blowups; it is not accepted. | Low held-out physical forecast and command-response residuals across conditions and horizons; application adequacy declared separately. |
| Model usability | Shared candidate supplies `fit`, differentiable batched `predict`, immutable `update`, save/load, canonical signal semantics and error-envelope provenance. Two flight archives load through the integrated API. Public v4's previous numerical qualification boundaries remain unchanged. | Self-contained artifacts usable independently of Glassbox controller internals, with clear scope and measured evidence. |
| Capability | Public v4 passes its 27 frozen synthetic cases. The new rigid-body candidate has analytic integration, causality, arbitrary-command-count, lifecycle and gradient regressions; it does not inherit the arbitrary-channel suite verdict. | Capability appropriate to the declared system class, measured separately from physical readiness. |
| Reference control | Shared physics executes 0.81 s, then fails on a nonfinite planning objective/gradient without contact. V4 fails before execution. The structured causal-history comparator passes with an 8.17 mm miss. One nominal trial per arm. The latest refinement executes 0.78 s, has zero converged solves and no contact. | General learner meets Dart's declared contact task through Dart's unchanged controller. |
| Live improvement | Public v4 has one demonstrated bounded offline update. Candidate update preserves revisions and development roles in lifecycle tests; physical update improvement and safe controller swapping remain unqualified. | Bounded immutable revisions with held-out improvement/regression checks; downstream adoption evaluated separately. |
| Evidence | Candidate envelopes use development data also used for checkpoint selection and stop at 250 ms. New held-out coverage and physical derivative fidelity remain unqualified. | Measured coverage within a predeclared band with explicit provenance. |
| Lean | Not met: legacy structured comparators and research harnesses remain. | Learner, artifacts/interfaces, telemetry adapters, harness and optional consumers. |

## Baseline evidence

The completed [shared-vehicle experiment](shared-vehicle-physics.md) provides the
saved starting models and current research API. Its wind and response-tail
failures remain obligations. Its 250 ms training and error-envelope provenance
do not qualify accurate longer-horizon forecasts, physical derivatives, contact
success or live model replacement. Public v4 remains the adopted public recipe.

## Latest iteration

The [no-fit recurrence diagnostic](recurrence-attribution.md) is **complete**.
All 30 saved original predictions reproduce exactly, all 90 local traces meet
the frozen agreement check, and the full raw replay and four alteration tests
pass. Smaller integration steps make the nine selected response branches fail
earlier; four substeps also make two of six matched factual controls nonfinite
for each model. All 54 response trajectories cross 1,000 m/s and 1,000 rad/s,
so a finite endpoint alone does not indicate recovery. Quadratic features are
the first recorded nonfinite quantity in all 58 failures, but linear state/history
feedback contributes most of the earlier angular-speed growth. Finite-prefix
step differences contract, which strengthens the case against using smaller
steps alone as a remedy without proving continuous-time blowup. The
[result record](harness/recurrence-attribution-v1-result.json) anchors the source
and evidence. No fitting, simulator or controller runs occurred; no model is
promoted. The preceding [optimizer experiment](optimizer-step-selection.md)
remains complete and not accepted, with its measured accuracy/control outcomes
unchanged.

## Next named gap

**Growth of the complete learned motion-state feedback.** Freeze one smooth
bounded representation of normalized motion-state features, applied consistently
to the current, historical and quadratic acceleration-readout paths. Derive its
scale from training recordings only. Preserve direct command inputs, learned
response timing and shared mechanics; introduce no consumer option or vehicle
branch. This single feature-conditioning intervention addresses both early
affine amplification and terminal quadratic growth. Its exact rule and evaluation
must be frozen before fitting; no successor protocol is frozen yet.

Bounded features are a hypothesis, not proof of accurate or stable dynamics.
Measure physical residuals and extreme finite outputs, retain Crazyflow response
and tail regressions and Cascade crosswind accuracy, and qualify Dart control
separately. The inspected response branches are now diagnostic regression cases,
not fresh held-out evidence for the next model. Commands within recorded
coordinate ranges still do not establish joint state/action coverage.

## Preserved boundaries

- The [public v4 adoption](public-mean-adoption.md) is a policy decision on known
  evidence; the original numerical derivative gates retain their failed verdicts.
- The [independent-recording update](independent-training-recordings.md) qualifies
  one bounded offline intervention, not universal updates or safe live swapping.
- Shared-physics forecasts beyond the fitted 250 ms horizon are recursive means,
  with no extrapolated calibrated envelope. Long-horizon fit and task adequacy
  remain separate from short-horizon improvement.
- The historical 1.47 mm structured Dart result used simulator-applied actuator
  state. The current comparator reconstructs latent response from issued history.
  Dart constrains the contact body's top axis and leaves yaw free; this is not a
  full six-degree-of-freedom pose qualification.
- Signal units, frames, timing and boundaries must be interpretable from telemetry.
  The rigid-body vehicle formulation has not demonstrated every articulated,
  flexible or arbitrary system. JSBSim breadth remains deferred.

The [continuation record](/private/tmp/glassbox-public-mean-qualification/artifacts/2026-09-19/public-mean-qualification-v1-continuation.json)
holds active stage handles and immutable source/evidence anchors. Source-bound
workers and all completed fits remain unchanged.
