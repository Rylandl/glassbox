## Unreleased

### Added
- Dual-control NMPC pass five (`dual_control_nmpc_pass5`): one goal over a
  one-second horizon of slew-bounded moves, with the spread propagated from the
  full-regressor planned posterior along the planned trajectory and coupled
  through `|f| sigma_tilt`, a declared maximum body rate charged as a chance
  penalty, and every multi-start seed derived from the posterior and the state
  instead of a declared amplitude ladder. `RecursiveBootstrapBelief` now exposes
  the two accumulated regression Grams the seeds and the spread read from. The
  pass is a recorded negative result: it does not recover the throw diagnostic
  on any release, and `docs/concepts/dual-control-nmpc.md` records why.
- Dual-control NMPC pass six (`dual_control_nmpc_pass6`): the fifth pass's
  horizon, slew moves, seeds, and coupling with the spread charged on the box
  average of the full regressor set, the goal charged only as far as the
  incumbent posterior can see, one descent seed per goal term, and collective-
  first probing at zero information. Measured on a sub-minute single-release
  gate, then the seven cases, then arm-only ensembles: 10 to 14 of 112
  recoveries against the fifth pass's zero, with the remaining losses split
  between early floor contacts and a lateral drift just outside the hover
  envelope. `run_throw_study_trial` accepts a `dual_config` override for
  single-release iteration, and `scripts/throw_gate.py` is that gate.
  Round two derives the knowledge term's neighbourhood from the posterior's
  own hover solution combined with the box prior, decides the goal horizon
  over the box, and advances the warm start in real time (`"step"`) instead
  of one block per interval, and offers each goal seed laid over the
  excitation cycle as a further candidate; pass five keeps the block shift.
  Committed round two recovers 54 of 112 on the arm-only ensemble, an interval
  that excludes every earlier learned arm and the working cascade and contains
  the certified cascade's point estimate. Explicit `block_lengths` are
  available and were measured as a negative result. Round three uses the
  posterior-mean maps in the rollout at the identifier's own authority, which
  stops a rank-one map from driving the goal the wrong way, and recovers 57
  of 112. `DualControlResult` exposes every multi-start candidate's objective,
  and the gate can fly any of the ensemble's own perturbed releases
  (`--draw`) and print the lowest candidates (`--candidates`). Six rejected formulations are recorded in
  `docs/concepts/dual-control-nmpc.md`.
- Throw-study trials stop at the first floor contact and are failures from
  then on: the contact sample is kept, the contact time is recorded, and the
  terminal and settled metrics are absent rather than read off the ground.
  Recovery counts are unchanged; post-contact metrics in earlier recorded
  reports are superseded.
- The Crazyflow plant raises `CrazyflowDivergenceError`, a `ValueError`, when
  the simulator hands back a non-finite state, and the throw ensemble records
  such a release as a diverged, unrecovered trial instead of ending the run.
- `glassbox record-results` regenerates the recorded artifacts under
  `docs/results/` from one manifest, in-process, with `--list`, `--dry-run`,
  `--only`, and `--include-slow`.

### Changed
- Rollout error statistics exclude the measured initial sample and every metrics
  dict carries a `metric_policy` identifier; the minibatch objective averages
  sampled windows uniformly (`deterministic_weighted_minibatch_v3`); complete
  flight rollouts apply logged wind per step.
- Belief updates score candidates without the held-out bias against the
  bias-corrected incumbent with a noise-scaled margin, bound every whitened
  prior coordinate to one standard deviation, and condition only on numerically
  resolved directions. Conditioning, commits, and prior initialization stale
  predictive-error evidence; `recalibrate_predictive_error` rebuilds it.
- NMPC reports stalls as `STALLED`, tests convergence on the projected gradient,
  shifts warm starts by command block, and has no dead command blocks.
- Bootstrap identifiers threshold nuisance directions at 0.002 of the leading
  direction and expose nuisance ranks; the online controller returns a bounded
  unusable decision on non-finite input; the supervisor uses a geodesic tilt
  error.
- PX4 ULog ingestion resolves a separate actuator hold-age tolerance and records
  per-topic source rates and segment coverage.
- `pymavlink`, `pyulog`, and `rosbags` are optional extras (`px4`, `ros`).
- The `model_family` module is now `families`.
- Documentation is restructured around a short README with concept,
  experiment, and results directories.
- The 24 `glassbox-*` console scripts are replaced by a single `glassbox`
  command with a subcommand tree: `glassbox fit`, `glassbox ulog extract`,
  `glassbox crazyflow throw`, and so on. `glassbox --help` lists every command
  and runs with no optional extra installed, because subcommand modules are
  imported only when one is dispatched.
- `workflows.fitting` is split into a library and a front end. A frozen
  `FitRequest` carries every fitting knob, `plan_holdout` resolves the
  training/validation split on its own, report assembly moved into named
  builders, and the argparse entry point is now `cli.fit`. Fit reports are
  byte-for-byte unchanged.
- The package is organized into `core`, `belief`, `control`, `io`, `workflows`,
  `integrations`, and `cli` subpackages; the root exports the stable surface
  and `glassbox.experimental` holds bootstrap identification, online
  bootstrap, the flight supervisor, and predictive ensembles.
- Duplicated helpers are consolidated: one NumPy quaternion-to-rotation and
  Euler helper in `core.geometry`, one pinned-download helper in
  `io.pinned_download`, one persistence score in `core.evaluation`, one set of
  selection thresholds in `workflows.selection`, and one set of finite-vector,
  world-up, and thrust-cascade helpers in `control._common`; all verified
  bit-identical against recorded outputs.
- `NMPCController.solve`, the recursive bootstrap update, the progressive
  bootstrap command, and the Crazyflow prototype are split into named phases
  and modules; the prototype module shrinks from about 2,450 lines to about
  540 with `crazyflow_telemetry`, `crazyflow_fleet`, `crazyflow_online`, and
  `crazyflow_supervisor_campaign` beside it.
- Test collection drops from about 21 s to under 2 s; the three
  benchmark-scale tests carry a `slow` marker.

### Fixed
- `glassbox fit --model --report` no longer fails on a NumPy scalar.
- Fits stop on non-finite loss and return the best finite iterate with a flag.
- Physical parameter constructors validate their inputs instead of clipping.
- Holdouts follow `benchmark_split` labels when present.
